/**
 * Binary Trees 
 * -A binary tree is a type of data structure in which each node has at most two children 
 * -common operations include insertion, deletion and traversal
 * -leaf nodes or branch nodes
 * -Balanced trees: the depth of left and right subtrees of every node differ by 1 or less
 *  allows for predictable depth -> Height
 * -measure of a node from root to leaf, root is 0 and subsequent nodes are (1, 2, ... n) = log2(n)
 * 
 * 
 * Two types of searches:
 * 1. Depth-first search (DFS): an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
 * -starts at root and explores as far as possible along each branch before back tracking
 * -three types: 
 * a. Pre-order visit, left, right
 * b. in-order left, visit, right
 * c. post-order left, right, visit
 * 
 * 2. Breadth-first search(BFS): an alogrithm for traversing or searching tree or graph structures, visit every node on a level before going to a lower level
